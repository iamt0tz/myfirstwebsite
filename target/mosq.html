<b>	Q:	What methods are used to control mosquitoes?</b><br /><br />
	A:   There are four basic approaches to controlling mosquitoes:
	 <b>prevention,</b> <b>source reduction,</b> <b>larviciding</b> and <b>adulticiding.</b><br><br />
	 <br>Preventing mosquitoes from breeding is the most desirable solution.
	 Unfortunately, many human modifications of the environment such as ditches,
	 ponds, and water management structures create mosquito breeding sites.<p>

	Source reduction is the elimination of water in which mosquitoes lay their eggs
	and in which the larvae develop. Source reduction is the second most effective
	method for controlling mosquitoes. Methods of source reduction involve eliminating
	containers that hold water and filling wet areas with soil.<p>
	Larviciding is the use of materials to control immature stages of mosquitoes
	or prevent development of larvae from becoming adult mosquitoes. Larvicides
	are applied to waters that contain larvae and or pupae. Larvicides are effective
	in low concentrations and generally do not impact other organisms in the water or habitat. 
	Adulticiding is the last effort to control mosquitoes. Applied as directed,
	adulticide treatments have minimal effects on other insects. Adulticiding is
	done at night when adult mosquitoes are most active, which is also when most
	non-target insects like bees, dragonflies and butterflies are not as active.<p><br />

	<strong>Q:  What is larviciding?</strong><p>
	A:   Larviciding is controlling mosquitoes in their larval stage.
	Larvicides are products used to reduce immature mosquito populations.
	They can be either biological or chemical products. Larvicides are applied
	directly to water sources that hold mosquito eggs and larvae. When used well,
	larvicides can help to reduce the overall mosquito population by limiting
	the number of adult, biting mosquitoes that are produced.<p><br />


	<strong>What is adulticiding?</strong><p>
	A:  Adulticiding is controlling mosquitoes in their adult stage.
	Adulticides are products that rapidly reduce adult mosquito populations.
	This can become necessary when larval control measures are insufficient
	or not feasible. <p>Adulticiding may be initiated when there is evidence of
	significant populations of mosquitoes, or if there is evidence of mosquito
	borne disease . The most common method of adulticiding is ultra-low volume
	(ULV) spraying. ULV spraying is the process of putting very small amounts 
	of liquid into the air as a fine mist of droplets. These droplets float on
	the air currents and quickly eliminate mosquitoes that come into contact
	with them. ULV adulticides are applied when mosquitoes are most active-typically early evening or pre-dawn.<p><br />

	
	Combination of techniques or methods  will be applied  to achieve  control.
	These methods involves  treatment  on the Adult Stage  and  Developmental stage,
	Measure  to prevent  their  breeding ground  or simply means destroying their habitat,
	Methods using natural way. 
<p>
<strong>Destroying their Habitat :</strong>
<ol>

	<li>Advice  your people to  examine  your surroundings  thoroughly  after a rain , looking for areas  with standing  water or holds the water. <p> </li>
	<li>Look and  throw away  artificial  containers , like  flower pots , rain gutters,  discarded tires, empty bottles, cans . <p> </li>
	<li>Get rid of tall weed, high grass and standing water.  Mosquitoes like the grass and weeds and by keeping it short will send them somewhere else. Standing water is where they breed and there are some watery places in your area. <p></li>
	<li>Change the water in flower pots every after two days. <p></li>
	<li>Always checked and clean roof gutters, removed trapped leaves and any other materials. <p></li> 
</ol>
